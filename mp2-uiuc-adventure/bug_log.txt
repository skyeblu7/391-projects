--------------------------------------------------------CHECKPOINT 1-----------------------------------------------------------

1) when moving right or left, the image displays whatever was on the opposite side of the image instead of the rest of the image
2) when moving right or left, the image has diagonal artifacts 
1+2 FIXED because...
I had "(*vert_line_fn) (show_y, x, buf);" instead of "(*vert_line_fn) (x, show_y, buf);"

3) when moving right or left, the image has virtical black bars every other pixel
3 FIXED because...
I had "p_off = (3 - (show_x & 3));" instead of "p_off = (3 - (x & 3));"

4) can't see full image
4 FIXED because...
had to change the displayed y dimension from 200 to 182.

5) scroll bar mirrors top part of image
6) flashing 
5+6 FIXED because...
I set "target_img = STATUS_BAR_SIZE;" in set_mode_x

7) black bars instead of solid color
7 FIXED because...
I added "SET_WRITE_MASK (0x0F00);" to write to all four planes at once

8) when I write to the buffer, it overwrites 8 horizonal bits at once
8 FIXED because...
I changed SET_WRITE_MASK to (1 << (i + 8)); and called copy_status_bar_image 4 times, one for each plane

9) cannot write consecutive pixels next to each other
9 FIXED because...
the memory layout of the buffer is not a simply x + 320*y, 
instead it was "SCROLL_X_WIDTH*(vertcalOffset+rowLength*(col % NUM_PLANES)+row)+col/NUM_PLANES + characterOffset*k + horizontalOffset"

10) strange artifacts at the ends of words
10 FIXED because...
used strcpy instead of adding the characters index by index

11) double draw of the first character being typed
11 FIXED because...
I had an issue within the loop I used to draw the characters. The index used
to choose the next character to draw was messed up, often outside the
length of the string.

--------------------------------------------------------CHECKPOINT 2-----------------------------------------------------------

12) LEDs won't light up
12 FIXED because...
When I restarted the tux, it started working

13) tux LEDs don't clear
13 FIXED becuase...
I need to update all the leds every time and send the hex mapping 0x0 for leds that are off

14) input commands keep repeating (instead of stopping until the cmd changes)
14 FIXED because...
I put everything in the while loop in get_command(). Once I took it all out, it stopped going crazy

15) some of the buttons activated the incorrect command when pressed
15 FIXED because...
My mapping in get_command was incorrect.


16) buttons lag a lot. When arrows are pressed, goes ALL the way to the edge
16 FIXED because...
forgot to reset button_pressed after processing the button

17) when keyboard is used from the terminal, double entries to status bar are recorded and arrow keys pan the 
room as well as display A, B, C, D on the status bar. INS, HOME, and PAGE UP display numbers and change rooms
17 FIXED becuase...
I commented out the compiler directive #if, #else, #endif. This caused two pieces of code to handle characters
typed into the kernel, and the one in incput.c always displays them on the status bar.
